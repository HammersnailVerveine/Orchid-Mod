The Orchid Mod aims to add content to the game in polished and refreshing ways.
You will not find the usual vanilla class items here, as the content Orchid Mod provides 
is based on new classes with unique and complex mechanics.

Orchid's content is heavily inspired, and tries to respect vanilla guidelines as much as possible.
Thus, the mod is balanced around the main game, nothing should overpower it, and the classes
should blend in as much as possible with the main ones.
