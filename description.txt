Hello there,
My name is Verveine, and this mod will be covering the ideas I had the courage to bring to life in the game.
It adds, for now, a decayed mineshaft structure you can find in the center of your world, giving you a smoother and more exciting start in the game if you can get down there :)

The homepage will redirect you to our discord server for now, where you can see screenshoots of the mineshaft, but a forum page will be created soon enough.
