The Orchid Mod aims to add content to the game in polished and refreshing ways.
You will not find the usual vanilla class items load here, most of Orchid content is, and will be based on
new classes, with unique complex mechanics, and new interesting biomes/structures to explore.

Orchid's content is heavily inspired, and tries to respect vanilla guidelines as much as possible.
Thus, the mod is balanced around the main game, nothing should overpower it, and the classes
should blend in as much as possible with the main ones.
