The Orchid Mod currently adds one (and a half) new classes: the [b]Guardian[/b] and the [b]Shapeshifter[/b].

These new classes are aimed at experienced players, looking for a refreshing way of playing the game. They can be considerably harder to play than vanilla classes, and might require some dedication to achieve a desirable damage output.

[h1]Guardian[/h1]
The [b]Guardian[/b] is a living wall, using heavy [b]Pavises[/b], [b]Gauntlets[/b], [b]Quarterstaves[/b] and devastating [b]Warhammers[/b] to crush their foes and defend themselves.
Unique [b]Runes[/b] will provide the player with long lasting damage, and [b]Standards[/b] will provide usefull effects in battle.

Weapons are tied to unique [b]Slam[/b] and [b]Block[/b] resources that should be restored using a good weapon rotation.

[i]Alternating between defensive and offensive stances while staying in the middle of the fight is the key to playing the guardian class effectively.[/i]

[b]The Guardian class has content spread thourough the entire game, and allows comfortably beating it[/b]

[h1]Shapeshifter[/h1]
The [b]Shapeshifter[/b] vanquises their foes by transforming into multiple [b]wildshapes[/b], each having unique abilities and completely replacing normal movement.

[b]Predators[/b] are fast, and excel at single-target, while [b]Sages[/b] are slower, but can control and deal damage to multiple enemies.
[b]Wardens[/b] unleash slow but powerful hits while healing their wounds, and [b]Symbiotes[/b] turn into powerful teammates, requiring a [i]multiplayer friend[/i] to function!

[i]Adapting to the unique movement of each wildshape, and picking the right one for each battle is the key to playing the shapeshifter class![/i]

[b]The Shapeshifter class has content up to the Wall of Flesh[/b]

[quote=Please, stop asking]
The mod does not have Calamity cross-content
It works with the mod, but the classes will be underpowered.[/quote]

[quote=Older Classes]
We are aware that the "old" Orchid classes have been neglected, and they have been put on hold for the time being.
We would rather work on stuff we enjoy, which in the end gets us to produce more content, of higher quality
Alchemist and Gambler are on the backburner for now, and shaman's future in uncertain. Therefore, its existing content was removed from the mod.
Content for the other 2 classes can be re-enabled in the mod configs if you wish to play them[/quote]
