The [b]Orchid Mod[/b] aims to add content to the game in polished and refreshing ways. You will not find the usual vanilla class items here; most of the content Orchid Mod provides is based on new classes with unique and complex mechanics, and new interesting areas to explore.

The Orchid Mod currently adds four new classes: the [b]Shaman[/b], the [b]Alchemist[/b], the [b]Gambler[/b], and the [b]Guardian[/b].

These new classes are aimed at experienced players, looking for a refreshing way of playing the game. They are considerably harder to play than vanilla classes, and will require some dedication to achieve a desirable damage output.

[h1]Shaman[/h1]
The [b]Shaman[/b] is a master of the elements, and uses the power of [b]Fire[/b], [b]Water[/b], [b]Air[/b], [b]Earth[/b] and [b]Spirit[/b] to damage their enemies.

Each weapon is tied to an element, and attacking with it creates a bond to it. The more active [b]Elemental Bonds[/b] a shaman has, the more powerful a shaman becomes.

[i]The Shaman class rewards careful weapon swapping, attaining its true potential by maintaining as many active bonds as possible.[/i]

[h1]Alchemist[/h1]
The [b]Alchemist[/b] is a slow, but powerful fighter, carefully mixing deadly chemicals to create powerful [b]Combos[/b] and [b]Reactions[/b].

Weapons do very little by themselves, and have to be mixed with others in order to be effective. Unique [b]Hidden Reactions[/b] can also be discovered to help one along the way!

[i]Experimentation and patience are the key to mastering the Alchemist class, as its high damage potential is hidden behind various combos for the player to discover.[/i]

[h1]Gambler[/h1]
The [b]Gambler[/b] uses a [b]Deck[/b] filled with unique [b]Cards[/b] to overcome their opponents.

Each card has a very unique attack pattern that the player must master in order to fight effectively, as they [b]cannot choose which one to draw[/b].

[b]Chips[/b] and [b]Dice[/b] will help with gaps in the player's offensives by providing unique timing-based attack patterns and buffs.

[i]By breaking the conventional way of dealing damage, the Gambler class provides a unique take on fights. Some good advice would be to collect various cards, and always adapt oneâ€™s deck to the situations to come.[/i]

[h1]Guardian[/h1]
The [b]Guardian[/b] is a living wall, using heavy [b]Pavises[/b] and devastating [b]Warhammers[/b] to crush their foes and defend themselves.

Weapons are tied to unique [b]Slam[/b] and [b]Block[/b] resources that should be restored using a good weapon rotation.

Unique [b]Runes[/b] will provide the player with long lasting damage, at the cost of some resource.

[i]Alternating between defensive and offensive stances while staying in the middle of the fight is the key to playing the guardian class effectively.[/i]

[b]Mineshafts[/b] are new structures found below the world spawn and scattered about underground. With various goodies from Life Crystals to Gold Chests to even special [b]Static Quartz[/b], exploring the Mineshaft allows for a smoother start to the start of a player's playthrough!
